Uses :ref:`ipyver` to track the loaded Assembly and module sources.
This was useful to see how compiled versions were loaded/imported and
show how to use these methods. This code all came from a one-line bug

from running in an independent system. As I could not get IronPython to 
debug trace each line had to be checked manually in the entire Lib/ code.
