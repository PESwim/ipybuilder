<h1>Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#code-of-conduct" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Like the technical community as a whole, the PEswim team is made up of a
mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on
every aspect of the mission - including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.</p>
<p>Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication
issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask
people to adhere to.</p>
<p>This code applies equally to founders, mentors and those
seeking help and guidance.</p>
<p>This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us and the technical communities in which we participate.</p>
<p>This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the PEswim ipybuilder project,
including any associated way through which communication and feedback are generated
using or accessing the PEswim project through email, GitHub, Read the Docs, etc.</p>
<p>This includes IRC, the mailing lists, the issue tracker, and any other forums
created by the PEswim project team which the community uses for communication.
In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person’s
ability to participate within them.</p>
<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report
it by emailing <a class="reference external" href="mailto:devPEswim&#37;&#52;&#48;mindspring&#46;com">devPEswim<span>&#64;</span>mindspring<span>&#46;</span>com</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="please">
<h1>Please<a class="headerlink" href="#please" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Be friendly and patient.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of</dt>
<dd>all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members
of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status,
social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion,
and mental and physical ability.</dd>
<dt>Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will</dt>
<dd>depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be
communicating in someone else’s primary language.</dd>
<dt>Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no</dt>
<dd>excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Commentors, Members,
and contributors to the PEswim project should be respectful when dealing with
other parties as well as with people outside the PEswim dev/debug/contributing
group.</dd>
<dt>Be careful in the words that you choose. We are a community of professionals,</dt>
<dd><p class="first">and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or
put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t
acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Violent threats or language directed against another person.</li>
<li>Discriminatory jokes and language.</li>
<li>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</li>
<li>Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying
information (“doxing”).</li>
<li>Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Repeated Harassment of Others<a class="headerlink" href="#repeated-harassment-of-others" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.</p>
<p>When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and
technical, happen all the time and PEswim’s ipybuilder development is no
exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of posting on GitHub
comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds.
Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand
why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that
it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus
on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.</p>
